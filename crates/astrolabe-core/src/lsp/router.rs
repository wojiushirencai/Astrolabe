//! Static query router: the question type picks the data source, not a retry loop.
//!
//! File-level import edges recall 100% of what a language server reports, so those
//! questions never start a server. Name-matched call edges recall 66% on
//! TypeScript and 18% on Python — for "where is this symbol referenced" that is
//! a silent miss, not a recoverable failure. The graph always returns something;
//! a dynamic "try graph, fall back to LSP" loop cannot tell a complete answer from
//! a ⅔ answer. Routing is therefore a pure function of [`QueryKind`].
//!
//! When a language-server query cannot run (binary missing, startup failure,
//! timeout), the router may still surface graph name matches, but it must label
//! them [`Confidence::Syntactic`] and say which server to install. Presenting
//! those matches as [`Confidence::Exact`] is the failure mode this module exists
//! to prevent.
//!
//! `pool.rs` / `queries.rs` / `diagnostics.rs` are separate workstreams. This
//! module talks to them only through [`LspProvider`] and
//! [`crate::lsp::LanguageServer`]. The graph is already available and is called
//! directly.
