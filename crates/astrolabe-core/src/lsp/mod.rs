//! Language-server access for the questions the graph cannot answer precisely.
//!
//! The split is measured, not stylistic. File-level import edges recall 100%
//! of what a language server reports, so those questions never reach this
//! module. Name-matched call edges recall 66% on TypeScript and 18% on Python
//! — for "where is this symbol actually referenced" that is not good enough,
//! and a wrong answer here becomes a wrong edit later.
//!
//! Design constraints, each from a measured failure in the systems this
//! project replaces:
//!
//! 1. **Never keep a language server resident.** Measured on Serena: four
//!    whole-repo reference searches grew the language-server subprocess from
//!    186 MB to 719 MB, and nothing ever reclaimed it — 94% of the growth was
//!    outside the host process, where the host's own memory limits cannot see
//!    it. Servers here start on demand and are reclaimed when idle or over
//!    budget.
//! 2. **A missing language server is a reportable state, not an error and not
//!    silence.** If `gopls` is absent we say so and return
//!    [`Confidence::Unknown`]; we do not fall back to name matching and
//!    present it as precise.
//! 3. **Never block the graph on a language server.** Startup and indexing of
//!    a real server takes seconds; graph-level tools must stay responsive
//!    throughout.
